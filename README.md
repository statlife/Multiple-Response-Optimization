Understanding Aspects Influencing Three Types of Multiple Response Optimization

A single response optimization typically involves either maximizing (or minimizing, which can be transformed into a maximization of the negative of the response) or hitting a target. Even though a hitting target problem can also be turned into a problem of maximizing the negative absolute distance between the response and the target value, Anderson-Cook et al (2016) shows that these two types of optimization process often have quite different behaviors. In this paper we investigate how different combinations of these types of optimization combine to give promising choices. We consider three scenarios with two responses: maximizing vs maximizing (MM), maximizing vs targeting (MT) and targeting vs targeting (TT). Since it is rarely the case that all responses can be simultaneously optimized with the same input settings, trade-off and compromises are needed. How the practitioner values the importance of good performance for each response contributes a subjective component to the decision-making that is not present in single response optimization.
